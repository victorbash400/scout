The domestic cat was first classified as the species *Felis catus* in 1758 by Carolus Linnaeus, and although this name is still the most commonly used, some studies suggest that the domestic cat could be regarded as a sub-species of the Wildcat – that is, *Felis silvestris catus* – and this term is used by some.",

      "content": "# Domestic cat :   Domestic Cat People began to domesticate cats in the Fertile Crescent about 10,000 years ago, according to DNA research. Modern-day cats descended from a subspecies of African wildcat, *Felis silvestris lybica*, which today is the most common and widespread wildcat. Another, independent foray into cat domestication occurred in China about 5,000 years ago with another wildcat species the leopard cat. Like humans, cats display a preference for a particular paw, with males more often favoring their left paw and females their right.*—**Animal Behaviour*If the family cat died in an ancient Egyptian household, family members might shave their eyebrows as a show of mourning.—University College LondonDomestic cats lack a taste receptor for sweetness.—*Journal of Nutrition*",
