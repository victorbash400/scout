I'll analyze your Zawadi Bora Curated Gifts business plan and create a comprehensive research plan. This is an exciting venture focusing on authentic Kenyan artisanal gifts with both individual and corporate market segments.        

Let me start by identifying the key competitors we need to research. Understanding your competitive landscape is crucial for positioning Zawadi Bora effectively in the Kenyan gifting market and developing strategies to differentiate from both direct competitors like Purpink Gifts and indirect competitors like Jumia.
Tool #1: update_todo_list

INFO:     127.0.0.1:64166 - "GET /api/plan/todo HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
Now I'll add market research tasks because we need to validate your target market assumptions and understand the size and characteristics of both individual consumers and corporate clients in Kenya's growing e-commerce landscape.   
Tool #2: update_todo_list

INFO:     127.0.0.1:64170 - "GET /api/plan/todo HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
Next, I'll focus on financial analysis tasks. Your projections show ambitious growth from 400 to 2,000 units over three years, and we need to validate your unit economics, pricing strategy, and funding requirements to ensure the business model is sound.
Tool #3: update_todo_list

INFO:     127.0.0.1:63552 - "GET /api/plan/todo HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
Now I'll add risk assessment tasks because operating in Kenya's regulatory environment while managing artisan supply chains and building an e-commerce business presents several operational, market, and strategic risks that need careful evaluation.
Tool #4: update_todo_list

INFO:     127.0.0.1:63562 - "GET /api/plan/todo HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
Finally, I'll add synthesis requirements to ensure we create comprehensive deliverables that will help you make informed strategic decisions and present your business case effectively to potential investors or partners.
