I'll analyze the Zawadi Bora Curated Gifts business plan and create a comprehensive research plan. This is an exciting e-commerce venture focusing on curated gift boxes featuring exclusively Kenyan artisan products.

Let me start by identifying the key competitors we should research. Understanding the competitive landscape is crucial for Zawadi Bora's market positioning and differentiation strategy, especially since they're claiming a unique selling proposition with 100% locally-sourced artisanal products.

INFO:     127.0.0.1:56190 - "GET /api/plan/todo HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
Now I'll focus on market analysis tasks. The business plan mentions Kenya's growing e-commerce sector and rising middle class, but we need detailed market validation and sizing to support the revenue projections and investment case.

Next, I'll create financial analysis tasks. The business plan projects profitability by Year 2 and shows significant growth, but we need to validate these assumptions and explore the unit economics more deeply.

Now I'll identify the key risks that need thorough analysis. This business faces unique challenges around supplier relationships, market competition, and operational complexity that require careful risk assessment.

Finally, I'll define the synthesis requirements to ensure all research is compiled into actionable insights and recommendations for the business plan evaluation.
Tool #5: update_todo_list

Perfect! I've created a comprehensive research plan for Zawadi Bora Curated Gifts with 54 specific research tasks across all categories:

**Summary of Research Plan:**
- **Competition Tasks (8):** Deep analysis of direct and indirect competitors, including Purpink Gifts, Jumia, and international benchmarks
- **Market Tasks (10):** Market sizing, customer validation, demographics analysis, and demand validation for the Kenyan and diaspora markets
- **Financial Tasks (12):** Unit economics validation, pricing analysis, customer acquisition modeling, and financial projection verification

- **Synthesis Requirements (12):** Integration of all research into actionable recommendations and strategic guidance

This research plan will provide thorough validation of the business concept, realistic market opportunity assessment, and practical guidance for successful execution.

Are you satisfied with this comprehensive research plan? Should I send this complete research plan to the orchestrator to begin the multi-agent research process?INFO:     127.0.0.1:62650 - "GET /api/plan/todo HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
