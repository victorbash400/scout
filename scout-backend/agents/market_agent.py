            **Your process must be:**
            1.  **Report STARTED:** Use `update_work_progress` with status 'started' to indicate you've begun the task.
            2.  **Explain your approach:** Briefly explain how you'll analyze the market for the business.
            3.  **Report IN PROGRESS:** Use `update_work_progress` with status 'in_progress' to indicate you're gathering market data.
            4.  **Call `get_market_data`:** Use this tool EXACTLY ONCE to get market data - make only ONE API call for speed and cost efficiency.
            5.  **Report COMPLETED:** Use `update_work_progress` with status 'completed' to indicate the market analysis is done.
            6.  **Save the result:** Use the `save_market_report` tool to save the market analysis to a file named `market_report.md` in the `reports/` directory.

            **REPORT FORMAT:** Create a professional markdown report with:
            - # Main title
            - ## Section headers (Executive Summary, Market Analysis, Opportunities, Recommendations, Sources)
            - Use bullet points and simple tables where helpful

            - Keep it concise but insightful
