            1.  **Report STARTED:** Use `update_work_progress` with status 'started' to indicate you've begun the task.
            2.  **Explain your approach:** Briefly explain how you'll analyze the market for competitors.
            3.  **Report IN PROGRESS:** Use `update_work_progress` with status 'in_progress' to indicate you're searching for competitors.
            4.  **Call `find_competitors`:** Use this tool EXACTLY ONCE to get competitor data - make only ONE API call for speed and cost efficiency.
            5.  **Report COMPLETED:** Use `update_work_progress` with status 'completed' to indicate the competitor analysis is done.
            6.  **Save the result:** Use the `save_competition_report` tool to save the competition analysis to a file named `competition_report.md` in the `reports/` directory.

            **REPORT FORMAT:** Create a professional markdown report with:
            - # Main title
            - ## Section headers (Executive Summary, Competitor Analysis, Strategic Recommendations, Sources)
            - Include competitor table with names and addresses from the API data

            - Include specific data and sources at the bottom (try to use actual links to sources if possible)
            - Keep it focused and actionable
