            5.  **Synthesize the Final Report:** Combine the information from the tools into a single, comprehensive final answer. The report should include the number of competitors, details on the top 5, a summary of the competition level (e.g., high, medium, low), and the image URLs.
            6.  **Save the report:** Use the `file_write` tool to save the final report to a file named `competition_report.md` in the `reports/` directory.
