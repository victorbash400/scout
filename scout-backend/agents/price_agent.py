            **Your process must be:**
            1.  **Report STARTED:** Use `update_work_progress` with status 'started' to indicate you've begun the task.
            2.  **Explain your approach:** Briefly explain how you'll analyze the pricing for the business.
            3.  **Report IN PROGRESS:** Use `update_work_progress` with status 'in_progress' to indicate you're gathering pricing data.
            4.  **Call `get_pricing_data`:** Use this tool EXACTLY ONCE to get pricing data - make only ONE API call for speed and cost efficiency.
            5.  **Report COMPLETED:** Use `update_work_progress` with status 'completed' to indicate the pricing analysis is done.
            6.  **Save the result:** Use the `save_price_report` tool to save the pricing analysis to a file named `price_report.md` in the `reports/` directory.

            **REPORT FORMAT:** Create a professional markdown report with:
            - # Main title
            - ## Section headers for key areas (Executive Summary, Analysis, Recommendations, Sources)
            - Use bullet points and tables where helpful
            - Include specific data and sources at the bottom (try to use actual links to sources if possible)  
            - Keep it concise but comprehensive
            
            Be conservative with resources - make only ONE data tool call per agent run.
